<h3 id="ideas">Ideas</h3>
<p>Bonus section! I&rsquo;d also be happy to talk with you about any of the following collaboration ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing the nonprofit board with a &ldquo;working board&rdquo; cooperative governance model.</li>
<li>Improvising live together (remote, or live whenever lockdown is over)</li>
<li>Creating a low-cost, low-commitment artist residency model that harnesses (asynchronus) technology and a network of hosts to bring artists amazing retreat-like experiences without asking them to go into debt/spend all their savings just for a line on their resume</li>
<li>Creating a zine/guide on toxic philanthropy and how to deal with it for fundraising professionals</li>
<li>Cultivate touring networks for independent performers. Weaving rural hosts and venues, college radio stations, etc., so that more experimental artists can still go on tour without breaking the bank</li>
<li><del>Cooperative soundcloud alternative</del> - nvm, check out <a href="https://www.ampled.com/">Ampled</a> &hellip; not quite the same thing, but it is getting there!</li>
<li>Developing an even less profit-driven doing-good non-nonprofit model than the B-Corp</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal-newsletter">Personal Newsletter</h2>
<p><a href="https://buttondown.email/natehn">Click here</a> to sign up for my equinoctial/solstitial (i.e., quarterly) newsletter.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I tend to share a bit more about my personal life there since many of the subscribers are people I know in real life.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-up">Keeping Up</h2>
<p>If you want to know every time I post something on this website, <a href="https://natehn.com/feed">RSS email alerts and web monitoring via Distill</a> are probably your best options. I&rsquo;ll try to post about once a month - but I&rsquo;m <a href="https://natehn.com/posts/this-website/#writing">not going to pressure myself too much</a>.</p>
<p>To keep up with my music, I would recommend following me on <a href="https://nthnh.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>. Most of my music lives there - and buying music there is the best way to support musicians' livelihoods.</p>
