This blog is part my effort to engage with the Internet in a different way. Up until now, I have been primarily engaging via corporate-owned platforms, without any real understanding of how these systems work, where the money is, or how it was affecting my life. 

In 2020, it has never been clearer to me that the way I maintain relationships, cultuvate them, rely on them, has nothing to do with social media platforms. It only oscillates between an echo chamber and a torture chamber--and rarely in between.
