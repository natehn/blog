### Hello!

I am an [ambient/improvising musician](https://nthnh.bandcamp.com/), [erstwhile radio deejay](https://www.mixcloud.com/nthnh/), [nonprofit worker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nthnh/), occasional activist, habitual researcher, [lay open-source tech enthusiast](https://github.com/natehn), [wannabe photographer](https://vsco.co/natehnnn/gallery), [dormant designer](https://issuu.com/wrflrifle/docs/summer2015), and [born-'n-raised midwesterner](https://natehn.com/posts/land-acknowledgment/)

I also watch sports, play video games, and hang out with friends - and I regularly frequent the local grocery store. I use he/him pronouns.

#### Now (updated 2020-01-15)

I'm in the midst of year three in NYC. Of course, being the city has been quite different under lockdown - it barely feels like I'm in New York! Anyway, here's what I'm working on right now:

- experimenting with video synthesis
- working with Open Collective
- working full-time at Donorly
- making ambient music
- learning to cook better
- working on this website
- moving my personal notes over to Obsidian
- re-reading the Malazan Book of the Fallen

(This is kind-of like a [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about).[^now])

### Colophon

This website is [self-hosted on a tiny Linux computer](https://natehn.com/posts/this-website/) using Hugo and Caddy. I recently experimented with solar powering it but right now it is plugged into the wall. The theme is lightly-modified [Cactus](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus) and the logo is based on an [Open Doodle](https://www.opendoodles.com/). This website is located on [unceded Native land](https://natehn.com/posts/land-acknowledgment/).
