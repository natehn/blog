### Hello!

I am an [ambient/improvising musician](https://nthnh.bandcamp.com/), [erstwhile radio deejay](https://www.mixcloud.com/nthnh/), [nonprofit worker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nthnh/), occasional activist, habitual researcher, [open-source fan](https://github.com/natehn), [dormant designer](https://issuu.com/wrflrifle/docs/summer2015), and [born-'n-raised midwesterner](https://natehn.com/posts/land-acknowledgment/)

I also watch sports, play video games, and hang out with friends - and I regularly frequent the local grocery store. I use he/him pronouns.

#### Now (updated 2020-03-29)

I've been in NYC for almost three years, but it feels more like 2 due to the virus. Here's what I'm working on right now:

- experimenting with video synthesis and glitching techniques
- working with Open Collective
- working full-time at Donorly
- learning to cook new things
- working on this website
- re-reading the Malazan Book of the Fallen
- figuring out how to deal with surveillance capitalism

(This is kind-of like a [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about).[^now])

### Colophon

This website is [self-hosted on a tiny Linux computer](https://natehn.com/posts/this-website/) using Hugo and Caddy. I recently experimented with solar powering it but right now it is plugged into the wall. The theme is lightly-modified [Cactus](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus) and the logo is based on an [Open Doodle](https://www.opendoodles.com/). This website is located on [unceded Native land](https://natehn.com/posts/land-acknowledgment/).
