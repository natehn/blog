## Welcome

This is my personal library. You can also think of it as a:

- blogroll[^1]
- link/resource/reference list
- bibliography
- card catalog

[^1]: For the record, there is no unspoken expectation that anyone listed link back to this site.

The purpose is to share resources that I think are valuable with the rest of the world - no strings attached. It's an alternative to corporate algorithms and a way of building our own online networks of information, complementing the [XXIIVV webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/), which you should also explore.

The content was first published on February 28, 2021, but will be updated on a regular basis. It is forever incomplete!
