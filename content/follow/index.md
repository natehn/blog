## Sign Up for the Newsletter

I run a personal email list called Natehn Quarterly, and I would love if you subscribed. 

**[Click here to sign up](https://buttondown.email/natehn)!**

It is an **equinoctial** and **solstitial** (i.e., quarterly)  newsletter with updates such as:

- fun highlights from the blog
- updates from my personal life (don't worry, nothing *too* personal)
- my latest music recommendations and releases
(and who knows what else)

Let's envision this...you click on [the link to sign up](https://buttondown.email/natehn). This is what you see...

You then enter in your email address, click "subscribe," confirm your subscription, and BAM! You're subscribed. It's just that easy.

You can also [check out an archive](https://buttondown.email/natehn/archive) of past newsletters or [follow the newsletter via RSS](https://buttondown.email/natehn/rss). In case you are interested, I use a lightweight app called [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) to send out the newsletter.

## Keep Up With an RSS Reader

The quickest way to get an update when I post new [writings](https://natehn.com/posts) is to **follow its [RSS feed](https://natehn.com/index.xml).** 

You can add it to an RSS Reader of your choice. My favorite is [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), which has a [great iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/feedly-smart-news-reader/id396069556), but there are also plenty of [free](https://alternativeto.net/software/feedly/?license=free) and [open-source](https://alternativeto.net/software/feedly/?license=opensource) options. (Apparently [Microsoft Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/subscribe-to-an-rss-feed-73c6e717-7815-4594-98e5-81fa369e951c) also has an RSS reading feature.)

## Get Automatic Updates by Email

If you do not use an RSS reader, you can also receive updates via email, either through RSS (my preferred method) or by using a monitoring app of some sort.

### Email Updates via RSS

There are several services that track RSS feeds and send you an update via email whenever something is posted. I have primarily used [Blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com/) over the years. (You can also set up more complicated stuff like a [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/gmail/integrations/rss/9216/get-gmail-emails-for-new-rss-feed-entries) if you like.)

### Email Updates via Web Monitoring

There is one option - other than checking manually - that does not involve RSS. Web monitoring apps, among other things, can check websites peiodically to see if updates have been made. One of the most popular apps for this is [VisualPing](https://visualping.io/), and it works well, but recently I have come to prefer [Distill](https://distill.io/), which has a web app and browser extensions, and can do its check using your computer rather than on the cloud. 

Either way, I recommend setting the time interval to at least a few days. Don't make a computer use a bunch of energy checking a website every hour just for my sake.

## Following on Github

To follow every little change to the site, feel free to follow on Github. ([Click here to see the latest content updates.](https://github.com/natehn/blog/tree/master/content/posts)) The problem with this method is that it also updates you whenever I fix a typo or make a small change to the site's design.

## Following the Blog

No matter which method you choose, thank you for putting in the effort to keep up with this site! Hopefully, the process has been carefree - feel free to [reach out](mailto:nathan@omg.lol) if you have any questions. Otherwise, you can just plan on hearing from me soon. <3
