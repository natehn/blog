## RSS

The quickest way to get an update when I post new [writings](https://natehn.com/posts) is to follow the **[RSS feed](https://natehn.com/index.xml)**.[^3] 

I recommend receiving RSS alerts by email, through a tool like [Distill](https://distill.io/).[^4] Or you can add it to an RSS Reader[^2] of your choice! 

[^2]: My favorite is [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), which has a [great iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/feedly-smart-news-reader/id396069556), but there are also plenty of [free](https://alternativeto.net/software/feedly/?license=free) and [open-source](https://alternativeto.net/software/feedly/?license=opensource) options. (Apparently [Microsoft Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/subscribe-to-an-rss-feed-73c6e717-7815-4594-98e5-81fa369e951c) also has an RSS reading feature.)

[^3]: RSS stands for RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication. We all owe much to the late Aaron Swartz, who helped develop RSS, along with Markdown (the syntax I use to write articles for this site), Creative Commons (the license under which this content is licensed), and Reddit.

[^4]: You can also set up more complicated stuff like a [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/gmail/integrations/rss/9216/get-gmail-emails-for-new-rss-feed-entries) if you like.

## Website Monitoring

An option - other than checking manually - that does not involve RSS is using a web monitoring app to check this website peiodically to see if updates have been made. I again recommend [Distill](https://distill.io/), which has a web app and browser extensions, and can do its check using your computer rather than on the cloud.[^5] The app will email you whenever it detects changes. I recommend setting the time interval to at least a few days - don't make a computer use a bunch of energy checking a website every hour just for my sake.

[^5]: One of the most popular apps for this is [VisualPing](https://visualping.io/), and it works well, but I prefer Distill's apps. There are also self-hosted web monitoring solutions available, like [Huginn](https://github.com/huginn/huginn).

#### Bonus Option: Watch the Github Repo

If you want all the gritty details, you can always see the latest updates to the website on [Github](https://github.com/natehn/blog/).
