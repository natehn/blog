## Open Invitation

Email me! Introduce yourself and tell me what you're up to. Tell me I'm wrong. Share some great content. 

**You can find me at [nh at natehn.com](mailto:nh@natehn.com).** I'm also happy to communicate using [PGP](https://natehn.com/publickey.nh@natehn.com-117996770f8b42bd6a1fff940e1562087d8b4490.asc). <3

### Ideas

Bonus section! I'd also be happy to talk with you about any of the following collaboration ideas:

- Replacing the nonprofit board with a "working board" cooperative governance model.
- Improvising live together (remote, or live whenever lockdown is over)
- Creating a low-cost, low-commitment artist residency model that harnesses (asynchronus) technology and a network of hosts to bring artists amazing retreat-like experiences without asking them to go into debt/spend all their savings just for a line on their resume
- Creating a zine/guide on toxic philanthropy and how to deal with it for fundraising professionals
- Cultivate touring networks for independent performers. Weaving rural hosts and venues, college radio stations, etc., so that more experimental artists can still go on tour without breaking the bank
- ~~Cooperative soundcloud alternative~~ - nvm, check out [Ampled](https://www.ampled.com/) ... not quite the same thing, but it is getting there!
- Developing an even less profit-driven doing-good non-nonprofit model than the B-Corp

## Personal Newsletter

[Click here](https://buttondown.email/natehn) to sign up for my equinoctial/solstitial (i.e., quarterly) newsletter.[^1] I tend to share a bit more about my personal life there since many of the subscribers are people I know in real life.

[^1]: You can also [check out an archive](https://buttondown.email/natehn/archive) of past newsletters or [follow the newsletter via RSS](https://buttondown.email/natehn/rss). In case you are interested, I use a lightweight app called [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) to send out the newsletter.

## Keeping Up
If you want to know every time I post something on this website, [RSS email alerts and web monitoring via Distill](https://natehn.com/feed) are probably your best options. I'll try to post about once a month - but I'm [not going to pressure myself too much](https://natehn.com/posts/this-website/#writing).

To keep up with my music, I would recommend following me on [Bandcamp](https://nthnh.bandcamp.com/). Most of my music lives there - and buying music there is the best way to support musicians' livelihoods.
