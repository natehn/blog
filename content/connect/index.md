## Open Invitation
Cold email me! I'd love to hear what you have to say. Here are some reasons to reach out to me:

- To introduce yourself
- To share something I might be interested in
- To talk nonprofits, activism, art, music, technology, politics, etc.
- You loved/hated something I wrote
- I'm wrong, and you're willing to tell me how
- To notify me of an error
- You'd like to hang if/when I go traveling

Or maybe it is none of these. If you want to talk to me, then more-than-likely I would love to talk to you. 

**Please feel free to send me an email at [nthnhwtt at gmail.com](mailto:nthnhwtt@gmail.com).** I'm also happy to communicate using [PGP](https://natehn.com/public-key.asc). <3

### Ideas
Bonus section! I'd also be happy to talk with you about any of the following collaboration ideas:

- Improvising live together (remote, or live whenever lockdown is over)
- Creating a low-cost, low-commitment artist residency model that harnesses technology and a network of hosts to bring artists amazing retreat-like experiences without asking them to go into debt/spend all their savings just for a line on their resume
- Creating a zine/guide on toxic philanthropy and how to deal with it for fundraising professionals
- Post-pandemic, create touring networks for independent performers. Weaving rural hosts and venues, college radio stations, etc., so that more experimental artists can still go on tour without breaking the bank
- ~~Soundcloud cooperative~~ - nvm, check out [Ampled](https://www.ampled.com/) ... not quite the same thing, but it is getting there!

## Personal Newsletter

[Click here](https://buttondown.email/natehn) to sign up for my equinoctial/solstitial (i.e., quarterly) newsletter.[^1] I tend to share a bit more about my personal life there since many of the subscribers are people I know in real life.

[^1]: You can also [check out an archive](https://buttondown.email/natehn/archive) of past newsletters or [follow the newsletter via RSS](https://buttondown.email/natehn/rss). In case you are interested, I use a lightweight app called [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) to send out the newsletter.

## Keeping Up
If you want to know every time I post something on this website, [RSS email alerts and web monitoring via Distill](https://natehn.com/feed) are probably your best options. I'll try to post about once a month - but I'm [not going to pressure myself too much](https://natehn.com/posts/this-website/#writing).

To keep up with my music, I would recommend following me on [Bandcamp](https://nthnh.bandcamp.com/). Most of my music lives there - and buying music there is the best way to support musicians' livelihoods.
